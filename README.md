# Shakespeare

    Make sure to edit the path if you want to run the file, we made a snippet of the text from the original shakespeare file to test our code on as Insertion and Selection sort was too slow to actually test the time of on the big file size.   So in order to compare it to the others, we have made a smaller test file.
  
  Results of our test file:
